# ABC to Alpha Bravo Charlie

I created this project to address a common challenge encountered during support calls. Spelling out words using the phonetic alphabet was a frequent occurrence, but I didn't have it memorized. To solve this problem, I developed a tool that streamlines the process and enhances professionalism and efficiency in communication.
